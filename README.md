# mrlearn
Machine learning algorithms in R.

The `mrlearn` package implements a wide variety of machine learning algorithms through a consistent interface utilising the S3 object system.

This package is mainly for self-practice (implement ml algorithms and create a package utilising the S3 object system), so if you are looking for robust implementations of machine learning algorithms in R I'd not recommend to use this package.
